# Action

Schedule your workflows to run at a future date and time.

This works using the `schedule` event to poll GitHub variables which are used as a database.

## Usage
Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/schedule.yml`). See [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Authentication

#### Example

This workflow runs on a `schedule` event every hour and checks the schedule for any pending workflows to run.

To schedule a workflow, manually do a `workflow_dispatch` by going to "Actions > üìÖ Schedule Workflow Dispatch", type when you want the workflow to run, and click Run workflow.

To use this workflow you want to replace the `workflow` input with the name, path, or id of the workflow you want to run. You should also change the `timezone` input to your timezone.

Make sure you've set your PAT to the `TOKEN` secret in your repository settings.

```yml
name: üìÖ Schedule Workflow Dispatch
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */1 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:

        description: 'Date to run the workflow'
